# Understanding the Business Problem  
A **business problem** refers to an **undesired outcome in a process**, which can manifest as a limitation, failure, or the consequence of a series of events. When developing a **Machine Learning model**, it is crucial to have a clear definition of the business problem. Without a precise understanding, resources may be wasted, and the final solution might fail to address the core issue effectively.  

### What is the Business Problem in This Project?  
This project addresses a churn problem for a financial institution that has been losing a significant number of customers recently. The goal is to predict which current customers are likely to leave for a competitor and enable personalized interventions to prevent churn.  

### What is Churn?  
As outlined earlier in this project, churn is a metric that measures the number of customers a company loses during a specific period. This period could be annual, semiannual, or monthly. Churn rate is critical for a company's cash flow because higher churn directly translates to reduced revenue. Even if the sales team meets its targets, high churn can disrupt cash flow balance.  

To calculate the churn rate (\(C\)) for a given period, divide the total number of cancellations (\(T_{cancell}\)) by the total number of customers at the start of the period (\(T_{start}\)):

\[
C = \frac{T_{cancell}}{T_{start}}
\]  

**Example:**  
A company with 1,500 customers at the start of the month experiences 215 cancellations during the same month. Applying the formula:  
\[
C = \frac{215}{1500} = 0.1433
\]  
Thus, the churn rate for the month is 14.33%.  

Lower churn rates indicate better customer retention efforts.  

### Why Do Companies Experience Churn?  
Churn often results from:  
- Misaligned commercial strategies or sales funnels that do not address the real customer profile.  
- Ineffective promotional actions due to poor understanding of customer needs.  
- Lack of processes for monitoring customer activity across various touchpoints, leading to neglect in the company-customer relationship.  

### How Can Companies Reduce Churn?  
To reduce churn, companies should:  
- Identify the reasons behind cancellations.  
- Focus on customer groups most likely to leave.  
- Enhance the customer experience.  
- Increase the perceived value of products or services.  
- Invest in customer relationship management to address issues promptly and effectively.  
- Align customer expectations with deliverables.  

### How Can Machine Learning Help Solve This Problem?  
The first step is to collect customer data. By analyzing this data, patterns can be identified to predict which customers are likely to churn based on the behavior of those who have churned in the past. For this project, the data includes information on customer behavior within the bank (e.g., number of services used, account balance, credit card activity, and account status).  

A Machine Learning model can address this problem by analyzing these patterns and predicting potential churners, allowing for targeted interventions. The key steps in developing this solution include:  

#### **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (and Feature Engineering)**  
At this stage, exploratory data analysis is conducted to understand the data better and prepare it for modeling. This involves:  
- Identifying variables that are conceptually relevant to the business problem.  
- Checking correlations and relationships between variables, especially with the target variable (churn status).  
- Examining the distribution of each variable.  

Feature engineering transforms raw data into meaningful features to improve the modelâ€™s predictive performance. Errors in the data, such as missing or inconsistent values, are also identified and corrected during this phase.  

#### **2. Analysis of the Best Model for Solving the Problem**  
For the churn problem, a classification model is suitable. Popular options include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, and XGBoost. The goal is to determine which model performs best for this specific problem.  

This phase involves testing different models, tuning hyperparameters (model-specific configurations), and selecting the model that offers the best balance of accuracy and efficiency.

#### **3. Model Monitoring and Evaluation**  
Once the best-performing model is deployed, it needs continuous monitoring to assess its performance and make improvements when necessary. Deployment can involve integration with existing software or the development of a new program. Regular evaluation ensures the model remains effective as data and business conditions evolve.
