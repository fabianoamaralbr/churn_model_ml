## Introduction
Churn is a metric that indicates how many customers a company has lost over a specific period, such as annually, semiannually, or monthly. The churn rate is highly significant to a company's cash flow because a higher churn rate results in lower revenue. This creates an imbalance in cash flow, even if the sales team is meeting all its targets.

The equation is simple: a sales target is set to cover all the company's costs and still generate a profit. However, when the company loses customers, the revenue from the resale of its products or services stops coming in, requiring additional efforts to recover what has been lost. The impact is twofold — not only does the company lose guaranteed revenue, but it also tends to incur additional costs as a result.

## Why Does Churn Lead to Additional Costs?
When a company has a high churn rate, it must sell more to compensate for the lost revenue. This requires greater investment in sales efforts, including hiring staff, running advertising campaigns, offering promotions, and more. Additionally, a high churn rate can harm the company's reputation, often due to negative experiences related to service quality, product performance, delivery delays, security issues, or perceived value.

Recovering a dissatisfied customer is typically more expensive than acquiring a new one. Beyond monetary costs, there is also the opportunity cost — the time during which the customer is not making purchases from the company.

Another critical factor to consider is the potential for lost customers to spread negative publicity. This can further damage the company's reputation, necessitating even greater investments in advertising, promotions, and public relations to counteract the bad press. In financial terms, churn can create a "snowball effect" of escalating costs.

## How Does a Machine Learning Model Help Reduce Churn?
A Machine Learning predictive model analyzes customer profiles and identifies those most likely to cancel a service or stop purchasing a product. By pinpointing at-risk customers, the company can launch targeted campaigns to address their concerns before they decide to switch brands or stop buying.

This proactive approach directly reduces churn, enabling the company to cut costs and retain its customer base more effectively.
